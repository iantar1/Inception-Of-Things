# p1: K3s and Vagrant
    - In this part, I created two lightweight virtual machines using Vagrant. Each machine has a custom hostname,
    passwordless SSH access, and follows modern Vagrant practices. K3s is installed on both: the first as the server
    (controller) node and the second as the worker (agent) node.
    $ cd p1
    $ vagrant up
